We Conducted a meta-research as well as came up with design ideas to help junior UX designers foster empathy with their users.
- Throughout the study, various qualitative research and design methods were employed, such as:
  - Interviews
  - Ethnographic studies
  - Cultural probes
- We gave out a design prototype called **Empathy Deck** to be used prior to designer-user interactions, which included:
  - Checklists for designers
  - A deck of art therapy cards intended to be used prior to designer-user interactions.
