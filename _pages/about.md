My name is Yishu Ji (pronounced as "Issue Ji").

I'm currently a senior undgraduate in the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in industrial engineering while studying a psychology minor.

In Tsinghua, I was honored to collaborate with Dr.Yukang Yan at Prof.Yuanchun Shiâ€™s Lab to explore user's body-cognition in VR environment. I'm also very fortunate to work with Prof.Jeff Rz on data visualization as an exchange student & visiting researcher.
