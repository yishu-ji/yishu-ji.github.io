<!-- ðŸ“¢ I'm looking for PhD position in HCI/HAI/VIS starting in Fall 2024!-->

## Hello! I'm Yishu Ji.
I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Cindy Xiong Bearfield](https://cyxiong.com/). 

Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I was honored to collaborate with [Prof.Yukang Yan](https://yukangyan.info/) in [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) to explore user's body-cognition in VR environment. I'm also fortunate to work with [Prof.Jeff Rzeszotarski](https://jeffrz.com) at [Cornell CIS](https://cis.cornell.edu/) on the application of LLMs on automatic data visualization as an exchange student & visiting researcher.

My research interest broadly lies in **"cognitive"** and **"visual"** aspect of **Human-Computer Interaction**. To be more specific, I am very interested in understanding how people would perceive/behave when using new technology, especially those incorporating visual information, through both quantitative and qualitative methods; and subsequently developing optimized tools or approaches to facilitate user experience as well as enhance the interactions.


<!-- Interest-->
Outside of my main pursuits, I've spent lots of time dancing or engaging in sports since an early age. I was recognized as a Chinese National Level Three Athlete in [Aerobics Gymnastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_gymnastics) at the age of 10.
