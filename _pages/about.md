My name is Yishu Ji (pronounced as "Issue Ji").

I'm currently a senior undgraduate in the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in industrial engineering while studying a psychology minor.

During my undergrad at Tsinghua, I was honored to collaborate with [Dr.Yukang Yan](https://yukangyan.info/) in [PI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) led by [Prof.Yuanchun Shi](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1180/4037.htm) to explore user's body-cognition in VR environment. I'm also very fortunate to work with [Prof.Jeff Rz](https://jeffrz.com) at [Cornell CIS](https://cis.cornell.edu/) on the application of LLMs on automatic data visualization as an exchange student & visiting researcher.
