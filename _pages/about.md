** ðŸ“¢ I'm looking for PhD position in HCI/HAI/VIS starting in Fall 2024! **

## Hello!
My name is Yishu Ji.

I'm currently a senior undgraduate in the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in industrial engineering while studying a psychology minor. 

During my undergrad at Tsinghua, I was honored to collaborate with [Dr.Yukang Yan](https://yukangyan.info/) in [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) led by [Prof.Yuanchun Shi](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1180/4037.htm) to explore user's body-cognition in VR environment. I'm also very fortunate to work with [Prof.Jeff Rz](https://jeffrz.com) at [Cornell CIS](https://cis.cornell.edu/) on the application of LLMs on automatic data visualization as an exchange student & visiting researcher.

Generally speaking, My research interest broadly lies in **"cognitive"** and **"visual"** aspect of **Human-Computer Interaction**. To be more specific, I am very interested in understanding how people would perceive/behave when using new technology, especially those incorporating visual information, through both quantitative and qualitative methods; and subsequently developing optimized tools or approaches to facilitate user experience as well as enhance the interactions.


Outside of my main pursuits, I've spent lots of time dancing or engaging in sports since an early age. I was recognized as a Chinese National Level Three Athlete in [Aerobics Gymnastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_gymnastics) at the age of 10.
